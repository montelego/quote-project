        <strong>Hi, I'm Muhsin Mohamed,</strong> a passionate softwera Developer
        dedicated to creating efficient, user-focused web application. Currently
        advancing my skills in front-end and full-stack development, I'm

        My journey began with ALX, where I've gain a strong foundation in
        JavaScript, React and more. Driven by a curiosity for technology and a
